<h1>Praat-Py: Praat with Python Scripting</h1>

<p>By Joshua Tauberer &lt;<a href="http://razor.occams.info">http://razor.occams.info</a>&gt;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="sec">
<p>Praat-Py is a custom build of <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">Praat</a>,
the computer program used by linguists for doing phonetic analysis on sound files,
to allow for scripts to be written in the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming
language, rather than in Praat's built-in language.</p>

<p>The motivation for this is to remove the need for Praat script writers to
learn an entirely new programming language if they already know Python.
Additionally, Python is a more complete programming language and so scripts of any complexity should be
more easily written in Python. The goal isn't to make all scripts easier or shorter to write, but
to make it possible to do some complex tasks more easily.</p>

<p>All of the functionality of Praat's scripting language is retained
when using Python, except forms.  Likewise, because
the Python interpreter is used, all Python functionality is possible, such as using
all Python modules that you happen to have installed.</p>

<p>This project is released under the same terms as Praat itself,
the GPL v2 or later.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<div class="sec">
<p>The following is an example script for Praat written in Python,
and on the right is the corresponding script in Praat Script.
The script converts all .aif files in a directory into .wav format, resamping them in
the process. The Praat script on the right is
based on the script <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~lennes/praat-scripts/public/convert_aiff_files_to_16kHz_wav.praat">here</a>
by Mietta Lennes.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Downloading Praat-Py</h3>
<div class="sec">
<p>Praat-Py is a replacement for the Praat executable file you downloaded from the Praat website.  I provide a ready-to-go version of Praat-Py only for certain platforms because that is what I have available to create it for.</p>

<p>You will need to have the indicated version of Python already installed from <a href="http://www.python.org">www.Python.org</a>.</p>

<p>The current version is based on
<b>Praat v5.1.17 (September 22, 2009)</b>
and
<b>Praat-Py v0.7 (September 30, 2009)</b> (<a href="dist/ChangeLog.txt">change history</a>).
</p>

<table style="margin-left: 1em" cellspacing="10">
	<tr><th>Platform</th> <th>Install Python</th> <th>Download Praat-Py</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Ubuntu 8.04, i386/32bit</td><td>Python 2.5</td><td><a href="dist/ubuntu_hardy/praat-py">Download</a></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Ubuntu 9.04/9.10, i386/32bit</td> <td>Python 2.6</td> <td><a href="dist/ubuntu_jaunty/praat-py">Download</a></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Mac OS X</td> <td colspan="2"><a href="http://clml.uchicago.edu/~max/">See Max Bane's website</a></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Microsoft Windows</td> <td><a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.2/python-2.6.2.msi">Python 2.6</a></td> <td><a href="dist/win32/praat-py.exe">Download</a></td></tr>
</table>

<p>On Linux, after downloading the Praat-Py file, you have to make it executable (e.g. <code>chmod +x praat-py</code> on the command line). Then you just run it (e.g. <code>./praat-py</code> on the command line).</p>

<p>If it doesn't work at all, you should install regular Praat from the <a href="http://www.praat.org">Praat website</a> to make sure you have everything required to run regular Praat. (On Linux, you'll want to choose the
dynamically linked version.) If you use a different platform, you will need to compile Praat-Py from its sources (experienced hackers only): instructions are below.</p>

</div>



<h3>Using Python in Praat-Py</h3>
<div class="sec">
	<h4>Starting a Praat-Py Script</h4>

	<p>Once you have Praat-Py, you can write scripts in either Praat's built-in scripting language or in Python.  You should be roughly familiar with Praat scripting before reading on (see <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Scripting.html">this page</a>), as well as <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  To script with Python, all you have to do is start your scripts with this:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">#lang=python</pre>
	
	<p>That is, the very first line of your script must be a hash (#) followed immediately by "lang=python" in lowercase letters.  This instructs Praat to interpret the remainder of your script as Python code.
	Without this special line, the script is run as a normal Praat script.</p>
	
	<h4>"Print" and "Go" Functions</h4>

	<p>There are several ways your Python script can make Praat do things.  The first way is via the <code>print</code> Python command, which will output a string to the Praat Info window:</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
print 11500 * 20</pre>

	<p>The next way is to have Praat do one of its commands on a menu or the main window buttons.  You do this with the <code>go(<i>command</i>, <i>arguments...</i>)</code> function.</p>
	
	<pre class="code">#lang=python
go("To Spectrogram...", .005, maxfreq, .002, 20, "Gaussian")
go("View")</pre>

	<p>The first argument to the <code>go</code> function is the name of a command on a Praat menu to run.  The remaning arguments are any options that that command takes, in the order that they show up in Praat.
	You'll notice that as compared to Praat Script, they way you put the arguments
	together is significantly more straight-forward.  To use variables, for instance,
	you just use them (no strange quotes). In Praat Script, you never quote the final argument. Here, you quote all arguments uniformly: strings are quoted, and nothing else, as in Python normally.</p>
	
	<p><code>go(...)</code> returns the selected object after the command completes, or None if
	nothing is selected. This is particularly useful for commands that create new objects in
	the Praat list. See <code>selected()</code> below. Here's an example:</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
wav = go("Read from file...", "myfile.wav")
spec = go("To Spectrogram...", .005, maxfreq, .002, 20, "Gaussian")
select(wav)
part = go("Extract part...", 0.0, 1.0, True)
remove(wav)
remove(spec)
remove(part)</pre>

	<p>The third way is to have Praat do something but to capture the result of what it does.  You can capture numeric results with <code>getNum(<i>command</i>, <i>arguments...</i>)</code>:</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
print "The end time is: ", getNum("Get end time")*1000, " (ms)"</pre>

	<p>As in regular Praat scripts, this works by capturing the first number the command would normally print to Praat's Info window.  As with <code>go</code>, you can provide any number of arguments to <code>getNum</code>. <code>getNum</code> returns a Python float value.</p>
	
	<p>There is also a function <code>getString</code> which works like <code>getNum</code> but it returns the entire output line sent to the Info window by the command as a Python string value.</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
print "The end time is: ", getString("Get end time")</pre>

	<h4>Selection Functions</h4>
	
	<p>Some additional commands are provided to make it easier to work with Praat's selected 
	objects. <code>select(<i>object name1</i>, [<i>object name2</i>, ...])</code> selects one or more objects by their names.  It's 
	just a convenience; you can also use <code>go("select", <i>objectname</i>)</code>. The argument(s) to select can be
	either Python strings that have the name of the object, or a tuple of the object type and name separately: <code>select( (<i>type1</i>, <i>name1</i>) [, ...])</code> . Here are some examples:</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
select("Sound mysound") # selects just a sound
select("Sound mysound", "TextGrid mysound") # selects these two together (and unselects everything else)
select( ("Sound", "mysound") ) # same as above, might be useful in some cases, note the double parens!
select( ("Sound", "mysound"), ("TextGrid", "mysound") ) # same as above</pre>
	
	<p>To add or remove objects from the selection, use <code>plus</code> and <code>minus</code> as in Praat scripting.
	They work just the same as <code>select</code>:</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
select("Sound mysound") # selects just a sound
plus("TextGrid mysound") # selects additionally the TextGrid
minus("Sound mysound", "TextGrid mysound") # deselects them
minus( ("Sound", "mysound"), ("TextGrid", "mysound") ) # deselects them using the tuple form</pre>
	
	<p><code>selected()</code> is a function that returns the selected object. It returns a <i>tuple</i> containing the
	type and name of the object separately. If nothing is currently selected, None is returned.</p>
	
	<pre class="code">#lang=python
select("Sound mysound")
(type, name) = selected() # returns ('Sound', 'MySound')

s = selected()
print s # prints "('Sound', 'MySound')"
print s[0] # prints the type of the object, "Sound"
print s[1] # prints the name of the object, "MySound"
minus(s) # deselects the currently selected object</pre>

	<p>(These new commands are defined in the <code>praat</code> module and are automatically imported.)</p>
	
	<h4>Other Shortcuts</h4>
	
	<p>Because removing objects from the Praat objects list is such a common task in scripts that batch-process files, there is a shortcut for selecting and then removing objects using <code>remove(object)</code>:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">#lang=python
wav = go("Read from file...", "myfile.wav")
...
remove(wav)
   or
remove('Sound myfile')</pre>

	<h4>Running the Script from the Command Line</h4>
	
	<p>As with Praat Scripts normally, you can run a script from the command-line directly (and never see Praat itself),
	besides running it from a script window.
	Say "myscript.praatpy" is a Praat-Py script, i.e. a Python program
	beginning with "#lang=python". You can then run it as:</p>
	
	<pre class="code">praat myscript.praatpy</pre>
	
	<p>You can also pass command-line parameters to the script:</p>

	<pre class="code">praat myscript.praatpy arg1 arg2</pre>
	
	<p>...and access them with <code>argv</code> As with the usual Python sys.argv list, the first element in this list is the name of the script itself.</p>

	<pre class="code">#lang=python
print argv     # this prints [u'myscript.praatpy', u'arg1', u'arg2']  (they're Unicode strings, assumed UTF-8 on command line)</pre>
</div>


<h2>Building Praat-Py from Sources</h2>
<div class="sec">

<p>You can build Praat-Py on any Unix platform... at least in principle. I build it on Ubuntu. YMMV elsewhere.</p>

<p>1) You will need to have Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed and the "python-dev" package (or equivalent) for your distribution, or an install from sources.</p>

<p>2)  Get the <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_sources.html">Praat sources</a> and follow the instructions to build Praat on
your platform.  (You don't really need to build Praat
now, but it would be a really good idea to make sure it builds before
going forward.)</p>

<p>For instance, on Linux, with the latest version of Praat at the time of writing:</p>

<pre class="code">wget http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/praat5117_sources.tar.gz
tar -zxf praat5117_sources.tar.gz
cd sources_5117
cp makefiles/makefile.defs.linux.dynamic ./makefile.defs
make</pre>

<p>3) Inside the Praat sources directory (i.e. <tt>sources_5117</tt> or
something similar), make a new directory called <tt>scripting</tt>
and unzip the <a href="dist/praat-py.zip">Praat-Py ZIP package</a> into that directory.</p>

<pre class="code">mkdir scripting
cd scripting
wget http://razor.occams.info/code/praat-py/dist/praat-py.zip
unzip praat-py.zip</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can check out the SVN module <tt>svn://razor.occams.info/praat-py</tt> <i> as</i> the scripting directory:</p>

<pre class="code">
svn co svn://razor.occams.info/praat-py scripting
cd scripting</pre>

<p>4) The Praat sources must be patched to build Praat-Py and to invoke the
Python interpreter instead of the Praat script interpreter
when the script begins with the magic string "#lang=python".  Do this to patch your Praat source files:</p>

<pre class="code">
make patch-praat
</pre>

<p>The patch also contains a number of fixes to make it compile and run properly on Ubuntu, and to cross-compile with mingw32 for Windows.</p>

<p>5) Then exit out of the <tt>scripting</tt> directory and build Praat.</p>

<pre class="code">
cd ..
make
</pre>

<p>The <tt>praat</tt> executable in the current directory will
now support Python scripts.</p>
