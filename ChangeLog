2009-09-30 Version 0.7

	* Added a remove() command.
	* Now it cross-compiles for Windows using mingw32.

2009-05-05 Version 0.61

	* Running scripts not from the command line was broken. Ooops.
	* go() now returns the selected object (or None) after the call
	  for convenience. Good for calls that create new objects.
	* selected() no longer raises an error but instead returns None
	  if nothing is selected.

2009-04-28 Version 0.6

	* Access command-line arguments from within the script with praat.argv or just argv.
	* Simplified the way we patch Praat.
	* Update for Praat 5.1.04.

2009-04-05 Version 0.503

	* Build update for latest version of Praat.

2007-12-22 Version 0.502

	* Revised the build process to be more Linux-neutral, and other
	  minor things.
	  patch.pl: Create a .bak backup file before making changes
	  to patch files.
	  Makefile: Insert python-config options directly, rather than
	  inserting backticks into the makefile.
	  Makefile: Don't use echo -e, since -e seems not to be universal.
	  Makefile: Don't patch sendpraat since we don't need it, and if
	  it's already been patched, we print a spurrious warning.

2007-11-28 Version 0.501

	* Changed the behavior of the selection functions
	  and added plus and minus.
